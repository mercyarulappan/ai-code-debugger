# **Title of the Project**

## AI Powered Error Handling System

An intelligent debugging platform that integrates runtime compilers with AI to automatically detect programming errors and generate simple, human-friendly explanations, helping students and beginners debug code efficiently.

---

## **About**

<!-- Detailed Description about the project -->

The **AI Powered Error Handling System** is designed to simplify the debugging process for programming learners by combining traditional compiler-based error detection with **Artificial Intelligence**. Conventional compilers produce technical error messages that are difficult for beginners to understand, leading to frustration and increased debugging time.

This project provides an interactive **Streamlit-based portal** where users can submit code, execute it in real time, and receive **AI-generated explanations** for compilation and runtime errors. Using the **Groq Large Language Model (LLM)**, the system analyzes both the source code and error logs to explain *why the error occurred, which line caused it, and how it can be fixed*, along with corrected code suggestions. The platform acts as a virtual programming mentor, improving learning efficiency and reducing dependency on trial-and-error methods.
